Description: # gazel
        
        gazel provides fixation algorithms for aggregating gazes, as well as tools to help you deal with edits that occur during eyetracking sessions.
        
        
        
        ## Getting started
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        #### Requirements
        gazel requires python 3.8.5
        #### Installation
        You can install gazel using
        ```
        pip install gazel
        ```
        
        
        gazel comes with a command line interface as well as a python library. 
        
        To use either version, you need 3 things:
        * itrace core file output
        * gaze file output
        * changelog
        * original source file(s)
        
        
        To get started:
        
        ```python
        # import gazel
        from gazel import fixation_filter, Tracker
        
        # run fixation filter to get fixations
        fixations = fixation_filter(gazes, changelog, sources, **opts)
        
        # Now track edits using Tracker
        
        tracker = Tracker(fixations, changelog, sources, language)
        # Note that you need to pass in the source code language,
        # to help `gazel` determine which parser to use.
        ```
        
        ## Base Functionality
        
        The main goal of `Tracker` is to track fixations and source code tokens across edits. Once you create a `Tracker` you can query it to get snapshots etc.
        
        ### Snapshots
        `Tracker` maintains a list of snapshots corresponding to the original file and subsequent edits. The original version is stored at index `0` and the first edit is stored at index `1`.
        
        ```python
        # get original
        tracker.get_snapshot(0)
        
        # get first edit
        tracker.get_snapshot(1)
        ```
        
        Each snapshot is represented by a `Snapshot`. A `Snapshot` is defined as:
        
        ```python
        class Snapshot:
            id: int
            source: Source
            tokens: Tuple[Token, ...]
            changes: Tuple[TokenChange, ...] = ()
            time: float = 0.0
        ```
        `Snapshot.time` represents the time at which a snapshot was created. It corresponds to the timestamp in the changelog that was used to create this `Snapshot`.
        
        `Snapshot.tokens` represents the parsed source code tokens.
        `Snapshot.changes` represents all the token changes that happened to this `Snapshot` since the last version. For the  `Snapshot` representing the original source, `Snapshot.changes` is empty.
        
        `Snapshots.source` is a `Source` object, containing the raw text of the source code, as well as mappings from text indices to line/column numbers and vice-versa. It is defined as follows:
        ```python
        @dataclass(frozen=True)
        class Source:
            text: str
            mapping: PositionMapping
            language: str
        ```
        
        ### Gazes
        
        You can retreive gazes for a given time window as follows:
        
        ```python
        tracker.get_gazes()
        # all gazes
        
        tracker.get_gazes(start, end)
        # returns a dataframe that is filtered
        ```
        
        The gaze dataframe is simply a `pandas.DataFrame` containing the original gazes, with some additional columns:
        * `syntax_node` - The syntax node associated with the gaze. `None` if the gaze doesn't fall on a token.
        * `syntax_node_id` - A stable id for the token associated with this gaze. `None` if the gaze doesn't fall on a token.
        
        `syntax_node_id` is a unique id that is assigned to each token in the source code across different snapshots. For a given token, this id is unique across time and space. Thus, you can use this id to determine how 
        ### diffs
        ```python
        tracker.diff(0, 2) # gives you the diff between version 0 & version 1
        ```
        
        ```python
        tracker.diff_time(2300, 2400)
            # gives you the diff between time unit 2300 & time unit 2400
        ```
        
        
        A `SnapshotDiff` is defined as follows:
        ```python
        class SnapshotDiff(NamedTuple):
            old: Snapshot
            new: Snapshot
            token_changes: List[TokenChange]
            gaze_changes: List[GazeChange]
            gazes: pd.DataFrame
        ```
        
        It gives you a list of all token changes and gaze changes. 
        
        Token changes can be of 3 types: `inserted`, `moved` or `deleted`.
        
        Gaze changes can be of 2 types: `deleted` or `moved`. (`deleted` means that the token to which the gaze was mapped to has been removed from the source.)
        
        By default, `tracker.diff(start, end)` will include all the gazes from the start of the experiment (the time at which the first gaze is recorded), up until the `end` snapshot time. If you want to only include gazes within the timespan of the `start` and `end` snapshots, you can pass an optional parameter:
        
        ```python
        diff = tracker.diff(0, 3, window_only=True)
        ```
        
        `gazel` also provides a pretty-printer to help you print diffs for inspecting the data. It supports print gaze changes, token changes and `SnapshotDiffs`.
        
        ```python
        from gazel import pprint
        
        diff = tracker.diff(2, 3)
        
        pprint(diff)
        pprint(diff.token_changes)
        pprint(diff.gaze_changes)
        ```
        
        `gazel` provides a module `transforms` to help you manipulate `gazel` structures including `Snapshots` and `SnapshotDiff`.
        
        ```python
        from gazel import transforms as T
        
        diff = tracker.diff(2, 5)
        
        # TODO
        ```
